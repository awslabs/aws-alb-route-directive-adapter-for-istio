# AWS ALB Route Directive Adapter For Istio

AWS alb route directive adapter for istio is used in [Kubeflow](https://www.kubeflow.org/) [AWS Coginito manifest](https://github.com/kubeflow/manifests/blob/e55cf3d73c68c56752b7c51f4c4de01062eff610/kfdef/kfctl_aws_cognito.yaml#L92-L96) as part of the Authentication and Authorization offering.

**Authentication** - After your load balancer authenticates a user successfully, it sends the user claims received from the IdP to the target. The load balancer signs the user claim so that applications can verify the signature and verify that the claims were sent by the load balancer. The load balancer adds the HTTP headers `x-amzn-oidc-data` which is user claims, in JSON web tokens (JWT) format.

**Authorization** - Route directives enable Mixer adapters to modify traffic metadata using operation templates on the request and response headers. AWS alb route directive adapter for istio decode `x-amzn-oidc-data` and retrieve `email` field and add custom http header `kubeflow-userid: alice@amazon.com` which will be used by Kubeflow Authorization layer.

This repo is built from [Route directive adapter development guide](https://github.com/istio/istio/wiki/Route-directive-adapter-development-guide). If you meet any problems, please follow that instructions.


## Compability

- This is originally built with istio 1.1.x. In istio 1.2.x, Adapter was removed and you have to enable it manually. Check [change notes](https://istio.io/latest/news/releases/1.2.x/announcing-1.2/change-notes/)
- This is not limited to `Kubeflow` usage. You can use it for any similar use case and customize it.
